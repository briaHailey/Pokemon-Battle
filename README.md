# Pokemon-Battle
This project simulates a Pokémon battle using statistics and details stored in three files. It processes data on moves, Pokémon stats, Pokémon health, and a sequence of battles to determine outcomes based on attack and defense mechanics. After the battles, it generates a list of conscious Pokémon sorted by their remaining hit points.
